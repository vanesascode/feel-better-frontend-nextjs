  "step-1": "Identify negative thoughts:",
  "step-1-explanation": "Recognize distorted thoughts or unhelpful beliefs associated with chronic pain.",
  "step-2": "Challenge thoughts:",
  "step-2-explanation": "Question the veracity and usefulness of negative thoughts, looking for evidence that supports or reinforces them.",
  "step-3": "Cognitive restructuring:",
  "step-3-explanation": "Modify negative thoughts with more realistic and useful beliefs, using techniques such as searching for alternatives, changing perspective and generating positive thoughts.",
  "step-4": "Regular practice:",
  "step-4-explanation": "Apply these steps regularly in situations where these negative thoughts arise, until you internalize the new thoughts.",
  "positive-thought": "Positive Thought",
  "negative-thought": "Negative Thought",
  "identify-negative-thoughts": "How to identify negative thoughts?",
  "identify-intro-1": "Distorted thinking is like a kind of trap that your mind can fall into. It's like your brain tricks you into believing things that aren't entirely true. These thoughts can make you feel emotionally bad and also influence how you perceive pain.",
  "identify-intro-2": "Some common types of distorted thoughts include:",
  "identify-1": "Catastrophize:",
  "identify-1-explanation": "Thinking in extreme terms about pain, such as assuming the worst or anticipating a future full of suffering due to pain.",
  "identify-2": "Personalization:",

  "examples": "Examples:",
  "important-regularity": "Why is it important to practice regularly?",
  "regularity-explanation-1": "The process of cognitive restructuring and weakening of the neural connections associated with pain takes time. It is important to keep in mind that these neural connections have been strengthened unconsciously over time, from the first unpleasant reaction to pain, and with each reaction until today.",
  "regularity-explanation-2": "It's not your fault, this is the way the brain works, although it can be changed.",
  "regularity-explanation-3": "Practicing new ways of thinking and behaving can change the brain thanks to neuroplasticity. These neuronal changes are essential for learning, memory, recovery of functions after a brain injury, as well as for the process of cognitive restructuring in the management of conditions such as chronic pain.",
  "regularity-explanation-4": "By being consistent in the practice and trying to change negative thoughts as they arise, you are working to weaken the neural connections that send the sensation of pain to the brain and create new connections that promote confidence and well-being.",
  "regularity-explanation-5": "Keep in mind that not only pain reinforces the neural connections that we want to weaken, but also fear, since a vicious circle is created in which the fear of pain increases sensitivity to it, causing us to perceive it with greater intensity.",
  "regularity-explanation-6": "Therefore, we encourage you to find those thoughts that do not help you and face them bravely. With perseverance, you will be able to gain confidence and strengthen these new connections that will allow you to better manage pain and even reduce its perception."
